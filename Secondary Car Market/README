#Project Description

#Background
The secondary car market is a booming sector. In this context, it’s referring to the market for cars outside of buying directly from 
manufacturers or officially sanctioned distributors.

Examples would include used-car dealerships, listings sites, sales by owner, etc.

However, one of the major problems in this market is the challenge of valuing cars appropriately. No one wants to buy a lemon. As a result,
companies like Carfax, Carmax, and Autocheck have built models for fair valuation.

In this challenge, we’ll be creating a rudimentary version of a car pricing model. We’ll be using price data scraped from 300,000 online 
price listings to train a model and determine the main drivers behind price.

#Objectives 
Learn to detect the outliers, do some data cleaning and feature engineering.
Train a model to predict the price of a car based on the available listings data.
