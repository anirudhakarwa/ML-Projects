## ML-Projects ##
### General ML Projects for Practice/Hands On/Fun!!! ###

Not all projects have a complete end to end solution/analysis with each step in detail. For example, a project might be aimed at doing just one of the following only (or might be doing some or all of them)
* Throw everything at a model and see the output (no data preprocessing). 
* Learn data cleaning and feature engineering
* Learn to draw inferences from exploratory data analysis/plots.

### 1. Secondary Car Market - Supervised Regression ###
* Supervised Model
* Regression Type
* Data cleaning and feature engineering try
* Data preprocessing (outlier detection)
* No data normalization
